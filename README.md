### Common Ground Public Data Repository

This repository contains public data for community verification and transparency.

## Our first airdrop data has been added! ðŸŽ‰

The first data available in this repository is for the initial airdrop (0001), which will distribute tokens from our first community sale, and also tokens granted as platform rewards for activity, airdrops, contributions and more.

**The first [snapshot for data verification](airdrops/0001/2025_08_20/airdrop_data.md) is available (2025-08-20)**

**Important:** If you already entered your wallet data on the [app.cg Token page](https://app.cg/token/), **please check** that your wallet and token amount are correct in this snapshot file.

Otherwise, you can still add your wallet address on app.cg. **The final snapshot will be taken 2025-08-28, 12:00pm UTC.** For those who miss this date, don't worry, there will be another airdrop for you soon.

**The distribution of tokens is scheduled to start 2025-09-01, 12:00pm UTC.**

Token distribution will happen through the [cg-airdrop-plugin](https://github.com/Common-Ground-DAO/cg-airdrop-plugin). The plugin can be used by any community and allows admins to create Airdrops from CSV files, and set up Token Vestings. It supports every ERC20 or LSP7 token on all 16 EVM chains that are currently supported by app.cg.

## What now?

Starting with the token distribution, the Common Ground Community will offer exclusive roles for $CG holders, which will grant access to special chats, events and information. There, we will plan the next steps in decentralizing our governance together with you, our early believers and community contributors.

Also, there's much more going on right now:

- app.cg now supports community plugins: use dApps and play games, right in your community, and fully connected! We offer the [cg-base-plugin](https://github.com/Common-Ground-DAO/cg-base-plugin) as a simple and powerful starting point for builders.
- We're planning to open source all app.cg code within this year, to then empower a fully decentralized Common Ground community network
- Another small, exclusive community sale is coming, to fund infrastructure and development cost. Stay tuned!
- $CG tokens will start to generate Spark soon! Gather with other holders and unlock premium features for free!
- We'll offer grants and bounties for builders! Integrate dApps or games as a community plugin, which other communities can then embed. Build real-time cross-community features, create new experiences with ingame roles, and much more.

That's just the short version, make sure to join the discussion in the [Common Ground Community](https://app.cg/c/commonground/).
