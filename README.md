### Common Ground Public Data Repository

This repository contains public data for community verification and transparency.

## Our first airdrop data has been added! ðŸŽ‰

The first data available in this repository is for the initial airdrop (0001), which will distribute tokens from our first community sale, and also tokens granted as platform rewards for activity, airdrops, contributions and more.

**The first [snapshot for data verification](airdrops/0001/2025_08_20/airdrop_data.md) is available (2025-08-20)**

**Important:** If you already entered your wallet data on the [app.cg Token page](https://app.cg/token/), **please check** that your wallet and token amount are correct in this snapshot file.

Otherwise, you can still add your wallet address on app.cg. **The final snapshot will be taken 2025-08-28, 12:00pm UTC.** For those who miss this date, don't worry, there will be another airdrop for you soon.

**The distribution of tokens is scheduled to start 2025-09-01, 12:00pm UTC.**

The token distribution will take place in the [Common Ground Community](https://app.cg/c/commonground/), where we will embed our own [cg-airdrop-plugin](https://github.com/Common-Ground-DAO/cg-airdrop-plugin). It will be used to set up a claimable airdrop for all community sale investors and airdrop-rewarded users. We will publish an FAQ on how to claim your tokens there, too.

**Make sure to only claim your tokens in the [official Common Ground Community on app.cg](https://app.cg/c/commonground/) - we'll provide further instructions there.**

### LUKSO and Universal Profiles

We realized that a lot of users have put their UP address as the token target address. Since Common Ground started as an EVM project, our token contract is on Mainnet. Please update your address to a mainnet compatible wallet address. The beneficiary wallet must be able to call contract functions itself and on Mainnet for claiming the $CG tokens.

Please check [the list of affected Universal Profile addresses](airdrops/0001/universal_profile_addresses.md) and update your claim address accordingly.

## And what now?

Starting with the token distribution, the Common Ground Community will offer exclusive roles for $CG holders, which will grant access to special chats, events and information. There, we will plan the next steps in decentralizing our governance together with you, our early believers and community contributors.

Also, there's much more going on right now:

- app.cg now supports community plugins: use dApps and play games, right in your community, and fully connected! We offer the [cg-base-plugin](https://github.com/Common-Ground-DAO/cg-base-plugin) as a simple and powerful starting point for builders.
- We're planning to open source all app.cg code within this year, to then empower a fully decentralized Common Ground community network
- Another small, exclusive community sale is coming, to fund infrastructure and development cost. Stay tuned!
- $CG tokens will start to generate Spark soon! Gather with other holders and unlock premium features for free!
- We'll offer grants and bounties for builders! Integrate dApps or games as a community plugin, which other communities can then embed. Build real-time cross-community features, create new experiences with ingame roles, and much more.

That's just the short version, make sure to join the discussion in the [Common Ground Community](https://app.cg/c/commonground/).
